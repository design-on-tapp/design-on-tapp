- 👋 Hi, I’m @design-on-tapp
- 👀 I’m interested in making a better world for everyone, through considerate design & effective code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some React, but I keep myself busy prototyping in Figma in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more about the world of work. If you'd like to give me work experience, or to have a chat about your life, career & field, I'd love to!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me on LinkedIn at Daniel Tapp.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I  designed a badge that was manufactured over 1,000 times, and now it's all over the world in people's homes.
